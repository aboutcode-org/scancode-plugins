ScanCode plugins
================

https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-plugins

These are various scancode plugins, some are builtins and some are extras.
Several of them contain pre-built binaries.

Each plugin is under its own license and in particular plugins that merely
bundle pre-built binaries use the license of these binaries.

This repository itself is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license (but there is
not much in it beyond build scripts).

The src-* directories contain the source code of pre-built plugins that contain
native binaries.

See also:

 - https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit
 - https://github.com/nexB/scancode-thirdparty-src (source for some plugins
   being transitioned)


To re-provision pre-built binaries, follow these instructions (only on Linux):

- install the system package for clamav, zstd and p7zip
- install the patchelf from sources (provided here in src/). This is done for
  you automatically below with a configure run. Older versions may be  buggy.

- then run::

    ./configure
    etc/scripts/fetch-plugins.sh
    clamscan -v *

In all cases, run clamscan or an up to date antivirus scanner before pushing
a new release.


To build the wheels for all the plugins::

    etc/scripts/build-plugins.sh

The dirs/ directory will contain all the built wheels.
